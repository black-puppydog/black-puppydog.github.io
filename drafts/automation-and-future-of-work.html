        <p>I want to write a bit about the effects automation will have on work and on society as a whole.
Throughout my education I have been workin gon technology which ultimately will not only drive people out of their jobs - it will make whole professions disappear into thin air.</p>
<p>This is going to be another one of thoses posts where I am not at all qualified to give a comprehensive view of the subject.
These are opinions, and as such are subject to change, which is part of why I write this.
If you have different opinions (or even if you agree with me) please  write me a few lines, I am happy to discuss!</p>
<p>During much of mankinds history, technology progressed at a pace where professions had a life expectancy much higher than that of the individual.
In fact in my mind most professions up to the middle ages were about as old as society itself.
Hunting, masonry, carpentry, all thse professions lasted for thousands of years and to an extent they still exist.
But with the industrial revolution things started to change.
Virtually over night, people lost their jobs to machines.
The pace of technological advancement changed so rapidly that teaching a new profession to the next generation was no longer viable.
Today, professions are so short-lived that one person can easily pass through two or even more professions during their career.
And thathas nothing to do with their individual abilities or foresight.</p>
<p>Today, society needs truck drivers. It simply cannot function without them.
Give it ten years and this will no longer be the case.
Computers are already quite good at driving cars. Automatic trucks are on the brink of being fit for market.
So this whole profession is doomed.
Will there be any truck drivers left after the machines take over?
Sure there will be. Some. For special circumstances, for special goods for example.
But most truck drivers of today will be out of a job within a decade.
Is this their fault for choosing the wrong profession?
I would argue that no. We need them, they do <em>valuable</em> work.</p>
<p>This is the key for me. Does work provide <em>value</em>?</p>
